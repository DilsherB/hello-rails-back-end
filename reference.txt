update config/initializers/cors to allow to be accessed by react (front end of your project)
  I commented out following lines for this
    Rails.application.config.middleware.insert_before 0, Rack::Cors do
      allow do
        origins "*" # here star means, it can be accessed by any app. we can specify a special one also(recomended)

        resource "*",
          headers: :any,
          methods: [:get, :post, :put, :patch, :delete, :options, :head]
      end
    end
run 'bundle add rack-cors' to install cors also
